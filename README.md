# Swin Transformer for Image Restoration

This project implements a **Swin Transformer-based deep learning model** for image restoration and super-resolution using PyTorch. It leverages the SwinIR architecture to enhance image quality, particularly useful for tasks like microscopy, denoising, and resolution enhancement.

---

## Project Structure

* `CCP_training.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook to train the SwinIR model.
* `CCP_testing.ipynb` — Notebook to test the model on sample input images.
* `output/` — Folder containing model-generated `.tif` image outputs.
* `swinir_best_model.pth` — Saved model weights after training.

---

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* PyTorch >= 1.7
* torchvision
* matplotlib
* numpy
* tifffile
* jupyter

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If `requirements.txt` isn't available, manually install the required packages.

### How to Run

#### Train the Model

Run the notebook:

```
CCP_training.ipynb
```

#### Test the Model

Run the notebook:

```
CCP_testing.ipynb
```

You will get `.tif` image outputs saved in the `output/` directory.

## Model

This project uses the [SwinIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10257) architecture:

> SwinIR is a Transformer-based model designed for image restoration tasks like super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG compression artifact removal.

## Sample Output

Here are some example outputs generated by the model:

```
output/
├── 001.tif
├── 002.tif
├── ...
```
